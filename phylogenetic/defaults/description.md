# Real-time tracking of Oropouche virus evolution

This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of Oropouche virus (OROV) based on publicly available genomes from NCBI and sequences from Florida's Bureau of Public Health Laboratories.

## Data Sources

### Public Data
- **NCBI Nucleotide Database**: Publicly available Oropouche virus sequences
- **Curated and processed**: Using Nextstrain augur toolkit

### Institutional Data  
- **Florida's Bureau of Public Health Laboratories**: Local sequences
- **Contact**: [Arnold Rodriguez] ([arnold.rodriguezhilario@flhealth.gov])

## Methodology

Sequences are aligned using MAFFT, and phylogenetic trees are built using IQTree with a molecular clock model. 

### Segment Analysis
- **L segment**: Large RNA polymerase gene
- **M segment**: Glycoprotein precursor gene  
- **S segment**: Nucleocapsid protein gene

## Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences used in this analysis.
